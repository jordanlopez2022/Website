        <h3>Potential Energy</h3>
        <p id="PotentialEnergy">The conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy is what drives the roller coaster, and all of the kinetic energy you need for the ride is present once the coaster descends the first hill.. Once you're underway,
          different types of
          wheels

        <h3>Velocity</h3>
        <p id="Velocity">Pendulum rides are a little like the swing sets you might remember from your childhood. Swings give you a feeling of flying in a controlled manner. You pump your legs to provide enough force to increase the height of the
          swing's arc, and
          enjoy the increased velocity of the downward swing. When you stop pumping, the swing gradually slows and then stops.</p>

      <img class="left" src="http://faculty.virginia.edu/skrutskie/images/weightless.jpg" alt="Weightlessness">
      <div id="example3">
        <h3>Weightlessness</h3>
        <p id="Weightlessness">Riders often experience near weightlessness as they approach the top of a pendulum ride. If the ride is the type that makes a complete 360 degree circle, they experience a feeling of complete weightlessness.</p>
        <p>Feelings of weightlessness are not due to a decrease in forces of gravitation; people do not feel forces of gravity. What you feel is the force of a seat (or other external object) pushing on your body with a force to counteract gravity's
          downward pull. A 180 pound person at rest in his office chair experiences the seat pushing upwards on his body with a force of 180 pounds. Yet at the top of a pendulum ride, the same 180 pound person will feel less than this normal
          sensation
          of weight. At the very top of the pendulum ride, riders begin to fall out of their seats. Since a 180 pound person is no longer in full contact with his seat, the seat is no longer pushing on him with 180 pounds of force. Thus, the rider
          has
          a sensation of weighing less than his normal weight.</p>

      <div id="GForce">
        <h3>G Force</h3>
        <p>As riders pass through the bottom of the circular arc, they often experience high g forces. Once again, these g forces are not evidence of increasing forces of gravitation, but the result of increases in the amount of force applied by the
          seat upon their bodies. Understanding this demands a little information about circular motion.</p>

      <div id="example5">
        <h3>Centripetal Force</h3>
        <p id="CentripetalForce">The motion of an object in a circle requires that there be a force directed toward the center of the circle (sometimes called a "centripetal force"). This means that at the bottom of the circular swing, there must be
          an upward force (since
          the
          circle's center is upward). Gravitational forces are always directed downward upon a rider's body; thus, gravitational forces cannot meet this centripetal force requirement. The seat must supply the centripetal force, pushing upwards on the
          rider with a force greater than gravity's downward pull. For a 180 pound person, the seat might have to supply 360 pounds of upward pull. This is twice the usual amount experienced by our 180 pound rider. For this reason, we would say the
          rider
          experiences 2 g's of force (a seat force that is 2 times the gravity force).</p>
